# Installing the OpenQuake Engine on a generic Linux distribution

The OpenQuake Engine is also available in the form of **self-installable binary distribution**.

### Differences with packages for Ubuntu and RedHat

This distribution has some differences with the packages we provide for Ubuntu and RedHat:

- includes its own distribution of the dependencies needed by the OpenQuake Engine
    - OpenSSL 1.0
    - HDF5 1.8
    - Python 2.7
    - Python dependencies (pip, numpy, scipy, h5py, django, shapely, rtree and few more)
- can be installed without `root` permission (i.e. in the user home)
- multiple versions can be installed alongside
- currently does not support Celery (support for Celery is planned) and clusters setup
- the OpenQuake Engine and its dependencies will not be available to system's python

## Requirements

Requirements are:

- GNU/Linux with bash
- libc version at least 2.14 (i.e. a distro not older than CentOS 6)
- 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 1.2 GB of free disk space

## Install packages from the OpenQuake website

Download the installer from http://www.globalquakemodel.org/pkgs/linux/oq-engine/openquake-setup-linux64-2.1.0-1.run using any browser

From a terminal run

```bash
cd Downloads
chmod +x openquake-setup-linux64-2.1.0-1.run
./openquake-setup-linux64-2.1.0-1.run
```
then follow the wizard on screen. By default the code is installed in `~/openquake`

### Upgrade from a previous installation

To upgrade from a previous installation you need to manually remove it first

```bash
# default is ~/openquake
rm -Rf /path/to/previous/installation
```


## Run the OpenQuake Engine

Before running the OpenQuake Engine its environment must be loaded

```bash
source /installation/path/of/openquake/env.sh
```
